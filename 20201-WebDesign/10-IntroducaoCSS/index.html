				<h2>But what about the roads?</h2>
				<p>You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo, where there's a demand there will be a supply; we'll all have our roads.</p>

				<h2>Is taxation theft?</h2>
				<p>If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?</p>

				<h2>So, what you're saying is...?</h2>
				<p>Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.</p>
